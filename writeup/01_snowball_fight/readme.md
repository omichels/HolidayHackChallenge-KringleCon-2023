### Location 

Christmas Istland: Frosty's Beach

### Task and Solution

Here you are given the impossible task to win in a game which is way too difficult, 
therefore it's your task on finding a way on how to cheat!

So, i used the chrome javascript developer console to modify a setting of this game:

- open the dev console via right-click
- switch to "room"
- search for interesting game settings, i used "playersHitBoxSize"
- modify the game value 
- a hitbox of only 1 pixel made my avatar effectively invulnerable
- play and win the game
